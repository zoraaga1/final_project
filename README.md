# 🛒 Hmizate Store

Hmizate Store is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web platform that allows users to buy and sell used products — including cars, phones, PCs, and washing machines. What sets Hmizate Store apart is its expert verification service: buyers can request certified experts to inspect a product before purchasing, helping build trust in second-hand transactions.
